                    <h3>Dear candidate,</h3>
                    <p>KASK / School of Arts Ghent offers a course in <code>Open Design for asylum seekers and refugees</code> currently staying in Belgium. The course programme focuses on Open Design approaches in media-, product- and systems design. The course methodology is based on co-creation and peer learning, and puts an emphasis on technological literacy and new media literacy.</p> 
					<p>This 8-week course is open for candidates who are in the process of seeking asylum and those who have been officially recognized as refugees. The course will accept a maximum of 12 participants. Selection is based upon a dossier created by the candidate and on an interview (see further). Classes are taught in English. There is no tuition fee, participation is free of charge.</p>
					<p>Co-creation processes  benefit from a shared understanding of Open Design principles, but also from diversity and multi-disciplinarity, therefore we strongly encourage all candidates with an interest in the programme to apply (regardless of age or background). </p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2>Course Description</h2>
					<p>The late 20th century saw the introduction of a vast array of information and communication technologies into society. In this, the beginning of the 21st century we are only starting to learn and deal with the real impact and possibilities of these technologies. One of the major developments can be found in the field of design, with the appearance of Open Design. Open Design is based on the free sharing of information, networked collaboration, digital fabrication; and fundamentally alters methods of creation.</p> 
					<p>Open Design is the development of objects, communication media or systems through use of publicly shared design information, alternative design methods and/or open tools for design. It is a heterogeneous field closely tied to the sociotechnical implications of the internet (e.g. peer-to-peer processes), and tools of digital creation and fabrication. It can be situated as much in the realm of applied design as in experimental media art or the broader context of online- or network-culture. As a cultural phenomenon it can also be seen as a field of discourse, critically expanding our notion of design and conceptions of society. Therefore you will study the subject of Open Design both as a technological and as a cultural, artistic or critical practice. </p>
					<h2>Course Level</h2>
					<p>This intensive course will provide practical and theoretical competencies, and aims at a higher education learning level. It offers a broad and general overview of Open Design as a contemporary sociotechnical phenomenon, and facilitates individualised indepth and practice based learning of specific Open Design strategies and tactics. The course requires participants to attend classes 3 days per week.</p>
					<h2>Course Method</h2>
					<p>The methodological approach of the programme is based on peer learning and co-creation. We strongly believe in embedding the core principles of Open Design into the very structure of the programme. </p>
					<p>Students are expected to bring their own knowledge and skills to the course, and engage thoroughly in sharing and collaborating with each other. For this approach of cooperative learning we seek to create a group of students maximising complementary expertise and creative talent, bringing together basic and highly specialised skills. In order to establish an interesting, valuable and unique learning environment, candidates are selected based on a competitive and carefully managed admission process. This process does not only try to identify skills and knowledge, but will also focus on your ability to share your expertise with others. </p>
					<h2>Course Focus</h2>
					<p>The course will theoretically and conceptually contextualize Open Design as an innovation practice and as a practice of artistic expression, as well as a practice of civic engagement. </p>
					<p>This course will introduce and discuss a broad spectrum of tools and methods and their underlying narratives. For this, Open Design is approached as a possible basis for various related fields in art and design. You will explore examples from participatory design, social design, critical design, speculative design and experimental media art (art and technology, art and activism, bio-art,...). Introductions are offered in free and open source software tools (for networked communication, media creation and digital modelling) as well as open hardware and digital fabrication tools (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, 3D printing, laser-cutting). You will experiment with these tools and learn to implement them in your own design and creation process.</p>
					<h2>Course Structure</h2>
					<p>The course has a simple structure, with the initial month emphasizing ‘input’ and the final month focusing on ‘output’. During the ‘output month’ you will translate your obtained understanding of Open Design and new media and technology skills into proper design projects. We foresee a wide range of possible outcomes which can include: media creations or publications (books, magazines/editions, texts, videos, audio-works,... ), digital creations (websites, apps, software), speculative design (objects, prototypes, visualisations,...), interactive objects or installations etc.</p>
					<h2>Evaluation</h2>
					<p>Final evaluation of the candidates is based on self-assessment. You will be evaluating your own and your fellow participants’ achievements. Moreover you will be asked to evaluate the course and help us refine it for future candidates. Please note that this is not an officially accredited course programme. Participants do receive a Certificate of Completion, but for now this is not related to an official degree. </p>
					<h2>Teachers</h2>
					<p>The course is coordinated by a core team of teachers representing  the design and autonomous arts departments of our faculty. Additional teachers of the faculty may be invited as guests during the course should this be required, as well as invited guest lecturers external to the school (designers, artists, scientists, technicians, craftsman).</p>
					<h2>Facilities</h2>
					<p>The Media Art and Printmaking studios will host the course. These studios offer shared working stations (Linux/Mac/PC), audiovisual facilities (studio, recording and editing equipment), a fab lab (3D printing, laser-cutting), large format digital printing, silkscreen printing etc. If necessary, access to other studios and facilities of the faculty can be requested (wood-workshop, textile studio,...). The campus also provides with lending facilities for borrowing equipment. The studios are located at an 8 minute walking distance from the train station (Gent Sint-Pieters).</p>
					<h2>Student Affairs</h2>
					<p>Participants of the open design course can get support by the Student Services Department of the School of Arts Ghent. We provide participants with information, advice and support on administrative, social and financial level.  Specific study or travel expenses to the course can be compensated.</p>
					<p>A member of the student affairs department will be present during the admission interview for specific information about your administrative situation as a participant.</p> 
					<p>If you already have questions about financial, social or administrative aspects you can contact us at refugees@school-of-arts.be</p>
					<h2>Institute: Who are we?</h2>
					<p>The course is organised by the Royal Academy for Fine Arts (KASK) in the city of Ghent. With this initiative specifically offered to asylum seekers and refugees we would like to welcome you to our institute and its community. As a faculty for higher art education we see it as our duty to actively engage in society. We strongly believe that an open society thrives upon education as well as upon culture and art. With this specialised course in Open Design we would like to offer you the combined strength and support of these foundations: learning through education, art and culture, as well as providing you with useful contemporary tools and techniques of our digital age. This course is conceived as a preparation for further education or professional orientation.</p>
					<p>In addition to this short course the faculty also welcomes refugees to its regular programme. +SEE AT BELOW ‘OTHER POSSIBILITIES AT KASK / SCHOOL OF ARTS’+</p>
